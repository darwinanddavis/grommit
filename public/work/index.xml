      <description>A website trivia for the Netflix series Dark.
A trivia quiz spanning all three seasons. The idea first started as a piece of paper job to test one of our brothers and his friends. Since they were taking it remotely online, we decided to make it into a website.
WARNING: Spoiler alert If you haven&amp;rsquo;t see the series, we highly recommend it.
Take the DARK trivia. </description>
